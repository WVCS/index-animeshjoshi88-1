         <td> Will Kyler Murray be at this Event? </td>

        <tr>
         <td> Why did Dak lose in the playoffs? </td>
         <td> Dak Prescott lost in the playoffs, because when you reach the pinnacle of greatness that he has achieved, winning such games is not quite pertinent. Therefore, he made the kind and gratiutous decision to help out a team in need that worked hard, which was the 49ers.</td>
        
        
     </tr>
            <tr>
         <td> Why do some people say that Dak is overpaid? </td>
         <td> Dak Prescott is being paid 35 million dollars per year, which at first glance may seem excessive, however if you delve deeper and acknowledge the lives he has changed during his beatiful, historic career, you will see that he deserves much more than the Cowboys can provide.</td>
