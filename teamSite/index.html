    <p> Anirudh Kannan is the featured player on the Mercury Hoops roster, he has been absolutely electric from all spots on the court and is a no brainer for this role. His stepback fadeaway has left his defender in the dust, and his tenacious defense has ball handlers on edge. If you are facing Anirudh Kannan, my only recommendation would be get ready to get cooked. He has been averaging 1.3 Points, 4.6 Rebounds, 2.0 Assists, and 8 Turnovers all on 17% shooting, in his last 10 games. #ScaryHours #Mercuryin4
